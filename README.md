## ðŸš€ Full-Stack Cloudflare SaaS kit

**_Build and deploy scalable products on Cloudflare with ease._**

An opinionated, batteries-included starter kit for quickly building and deploying SaaS products on Cloudflare.

This is the same stack I used to build [Supermemory.ai](https://Supermemory.ai) which is open source at [git.new/memory](https://git.new/memory)

### The stack includes:
- [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) for monorepo management
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for frontend
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) for database access
- [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) for authentication
- [Cloudflare D1](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/d1/) for serverless databases
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) for hosting
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for formatting and linting
- [ShadcnUI](https://shadcn.com/) as the component library

... while still being minimal and composable.

## Getting started

To use, simply clone this repo by running the following commands:

1. Make sure that you have [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/#installupdate-wrangler) installed. And also that you have logged in with `wrangler login` (You'll need a Cloudflare account)

2. Run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/Dhravya/cloudflare-saas-stack
cd cloudflare-saas-stack
npm i -g bun
bun install
bun run setup
```

That's it. You're ready to go! Next time, you can just run `bun run dev` and start developing.

When you're ready to deploy, run `bun run deploy` to deploy to Cloudflare.

> If it fails, get your account id using these [steps](https://github.com/Dhravya/cloudflare-saas-stack/issues/11#issuecomment-2246060464) and set the `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` environment variable to your account id. See [this issue](https://github.com/Dhravya/cloudflare-saas-stack/issues/11) for details.

To apply database migrations, run `bun run migrate:prd`.

### Cloudflare R2 Bucket Cors / File Upload

Don't forget to add the CORS policy to the R2 bucket.

Add the allowed origins to the bucket CORS policy.

The CORS policy on the bucker must be like this:
```JSON
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "http://localhost:3000",
      "https://your-domain.com"
    ],
    "AllowedMethods": [
      "GET",
      "PUT"
    ],
    "AllowedHeaders": [
      "Content-Type"
    ],
    "ExposeHeaders": [
      "ETag"
    ]
  }
]
```

You can now test the file upload by going to `http://localhost:3000/upload` and uploading a file.

### Manual setup

An automatic setup script is provided, but you can also manually set up the following:

1. Create a Cloudflare account and install the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/#installupdate-wrangler).
2. Create a D1 database under "Workers and Pages" in the Cloudflare dashboard, or run ``bunx wrangler d1 create ${dbName}`
3. Create a `.dev.vars` file in `apps/web` with the following content (Get these from google developer console):
```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=${your-google-client-id}
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=${your-google-client-secret}
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=${your-secret}
```
4. In `apps/web`, run this command to make migrations to setup auth with database: `bunx wrangler d1 execute ${dbName} --local --file=migrations/0000_setup.sql`. This creates a local version of the database and creates the appropriate tables.
5. Run remote migration for the production database - same command but replace `--local` with `--remote`: `bunx wrangler d1 execute ${dbName} --remote --file=migrations/0000_setup.sql`
6. Bun `bun run dev` to start the development server.
7. Run `bun run deploy` to deploy to Cloudflare.


### The beauty of this stack

It's fully scalable and composable. 
Want to add a backend hono worker, or a python backend? sure! Just put it in the monorepo and deploy. 

there's no environment variables.
want to use database? just env.DB. Want a Key-value instance? env.KV. want a queue? env.Queue.

want AI? env. AI

tools are incredible. there's wrangler - you can use wrangler to create/delete databases run migrations and all sorts.

Getting a lot of traffic? me too. I pay $5/month, for all of my projects hosted at the same time. (see https://supermemory.ai, https://md.dhr.wtf and more)
